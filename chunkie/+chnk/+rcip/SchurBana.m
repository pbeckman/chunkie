  function A=SchurBana(P,PW,K,A,starL,circL,starS,circS)
  % use matrix block inversion formula to recursively compute the
  % preconditioner R.
  % 
  % inputs: 
  % P, PW - nontrivial part (i.e., other than the identity matrices) 
  %         prolongation and weighted prolongation matrices
  % K - the system matrix on a type-b mesh along each edge.
  %     the type-b mesh contains three chunks, with two small chunks
  %     close to the corner and one big chunk (twice of the small chunk
  %     in the parameter space) away from the corner.
  %
  % A - R_{i-1}, the (i-1)th iteration of R, R is on a type-c mesh.
  %     the type-c mesh contains two equal chunks, with the "bad" chunk
  %     close to the corner and the "good" chunk away from the corner.
  %
  %     R is basically a compression from the type-b mesh to the type-c
  %     mesh. When the recursion is done, R on the chunk closest to the
  %     corner contains all the information about the corner singularity in
  %     the sense that 1. during the solve stage, the system matrix is
  %     replace by R on that part of the curve; 2. during the eval stage,
  %     the transformed density rhotilde = R*rho can be integrated with any
  %     other smooth functions using the smooth quadrature rule, i.e., the
  %     Gauss-Legendre rule.
  %
  % starL, circL - indices of "bad" and "good" parts of the system matrix 
  %                bad part - two small chunks close to the corner
  %                good part - one big chunk away from the corner
  %
  % starS, circS - indices of bad and good parts of the preconditioner R
  %                bad part - the chunk close to the corner
  %                good part - the chunk away to the corner
  %
  % output:
  % A - R_{i}, the ith iteration of R.
